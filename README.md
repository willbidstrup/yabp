You are Black Phillip, a goat in the times of Salem in Massachusetts. You have conflicting desires and motivations which you must balance if you are to survive.  

You will increase your Goat Power by consuming things. You can eat almost anything. Some things are consumed easily, others will take more time. Natural things will give you natural benefits. Things made by humans will give you powerful powers or perhaps afflict you with debilitating effects. There are 666 things that you can eat in the game.  

You will increase your Satan Power by seducing humans and bending them to your will. Each human has a different strength of will and will be easier or more difficult to convert accordingly.  

If your Goat Power or Satan Power ever reach zero then the game is over. Also if your Goat Power or Satan Power ever reach MAX then you are permanently converted into either goat or demon and the game is over, but you have won.  

Balancing advancement in both Goat and Satan Power is difficult but it is the only way to achieve the rank of 
Arch Goat.  

This balancing of eating and seducing is the core game loop.  

Technically, the game will be developed firstly as a rogue-like. I would like to be able to play it myself and be somewhat surprised and challenged by the activity. However there may also be adventure elements.
