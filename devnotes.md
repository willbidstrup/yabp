Today I begin development on You Are Black Phillip.  

This file will contain my dev notes and in time might become a blog.  

I am going to follow this tutotial - http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/  

## Part 0  

I successfully checked my Python installation (v3.8.5) and set up a virtual environment in my local folder for development.  

python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment  

To **activate** the Dev environment I see to run   

$ source /Users/williambidstrup/Documents/GitHub/yabp/game_dev/bin/activate  

To **deactivate** I run  

$ deactivate  

To **install requirements** I run  

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Part 1  

I successfully got the '@' symbol to move around.  

I want to see how to get background music playing as well.  

Lucidchart of the file structure is here - https://app.lucidchart.com/documents/edit/dfe67224-a77d-4be0-b448-8b7a0d3b5887/0_0?beaconFlowId=AD6E1E2383A9502E

## Part 2

This was a pretty heavy section. I did a lit of typing and while I followed it all a bit, I will want to go back over this a few times.  

I now have seven scripts doing the work.  

Feels like good progress though, seeing that character move around is starting to spark my imagination.

Today I contine adding elements of the dungeon generator.  

This is becoming my daily practice of touch typing and Python coding.

## Part 3

I successfully created the dingeon creation algorithm. I am beginning to realise that learining hoe to make games is the superior way to learn programming. It seems to require many aspects of coding I have not considered before.  

My mind is buzzing with things to do including setting up a  GitHub project and actually joining the Reddit group which created the awesome tutorial.
