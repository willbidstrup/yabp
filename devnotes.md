Today I begin development on You Are Black Phillip.  

This file will contain my dev notes and in time might become a blog.  

I am going to follow this tutotial - http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/  

## Part 0  

I successfully checked my Python installation (v3.8.5) and set up a virtual environment in my local folder for development.  

python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment  

To **activate** the Dev environment I see to run   

$ source /Users/williambidstrup/Documents/GitHub/yabp/game_dev/bin/activate  

To **deactivate** I run  

$ deactivate  

To **install requirements** I run  

pip install -r requirements.txt
